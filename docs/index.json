    "keywords": "3M IoT Platform Overview 3M's IoT Platform on Azure offers an end-to-end solution for acceleration innovation and time-to-market by offering core sources that can be integrated into custom IoT Solutions. Device Management, Security, and cloud resource provisioning and other core requirements of any IoT solution can use the platform's user interface to manage devices. In addition, platform APIs offer direct integration to allow development to focus on their unique business objectives instead of common requirements. The platform combines Azure and custom services to pride a generic implementation ready for any IoT business scenario. The platform code is available on GitHub where new features can be tracked and requested using the issues list. Currently requests are restricted to 3M. To learn how to request features or report issues, see the documentation TODO . Logical Architecture The following diagram outlines the logical components of the platform overlaid on the IoT architecture: IoT Hub The IoT Hub is a Microsoft Azure Resource used to ingest telemetry sent from both real and siulated devices into the cloud. The hub makes the teletry available to the services in the IoT solution for processing. The IoT Hub also provides the following: Maintains an identity registry that stores the IDs and authentication keys of all the devices permitted to connect to the portal. Invokes methods on your devices on behalf of the solution accelerator. Maintains device twins for all registered devices. A device twin stores the property values reported by a device. A device twin also stores desired properties, set in the solution portal, for the device to retrieve when it next connects. Schedules jobs to set properties for multiple devices or invoke methods on multiple devices. Presentation A web user interface is available for device management. It offers a user friendly way to register and configure devices, deploy firmware, and manage alerts, and provides a dashboard for generally observing device telemetry. The web user interface is a React Javascript application that: Is served to the browser via backend services Is styled with Css and SaSS Interacts with other backend services like the authentication and authorization service to protect user data and communicate with Azure resources Backend Services The platform is made up several services running in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) . The platform containerizes services to offer enterprise-grade security and scalability. The services - often called microservices - are written in .NET (C#) and provide RESTful endpoints that can be used for direct integration in business specific solutions. Data processing and analytics The solution includes the following components in the data processing and analytics part of the logical architecture: IoT Hub manager The solution includes the IoT Hub manager microservice to handle interactions with your IoT hub such as: Creating and managing IoT devices. Managing device twins. Invoking methods on devices. Managing IoT credentials. This service also runs IoT Hub queries to retrieve devices belonging to user-defined groups. The microservice provides a RESTful endpoint to manage devices and device twins, invoke methods, and run IoT Hub queries. Device telemetry The device telemetry microservice provides a RESTful endpoint for read access to device telemetry stored in Time Series Insights. The RESTful endpoint also enables CRUD operations on rules and read/write access for alarm definitions from storage. Storage adapter The storage adapter microservice manages key-value pairs, abstracting the storage service semantics, and presenting a simple interface to store data of any format using Azure Cosmos DB. Values are organized in collections. You can work on individual values or fetch entire collections. Complex data structures are serialized by the clients and managed as simple text payload. The service provides a RESTful endpoint for CRUD operations on key-value pairs. values Azure Cosmos DB Deployments use Azure Cosmos DB to store rules, alerts, configuration settings, and all other cold storage. Azure Stream Analytics The Azure Stream Analytics manager microservice manages Azure Stream Analytics (ASA) jobs, including setting their configuration,starting and stopping them, and monitoring their status. The ASA job is supported by two reference data sets. One data set defines rules and one defines device groups. The rules reference data is generated from the information managed by the device telemetry microservice. The Azure Stream Analytics manager microservice transforms telemetry rules into stream processing logic. The device groups reference data is used to identify which group of rules to apply to an incoming telemetry message. The device groups are managed by the configuration microservice and use Azure IoT Hub device twin queries. The ASA jobs deliver the telemetry from the connected devices to Time Series Insights for storage and analysis. Azure Stream Analytics is an event-processing engine that allows you to examine high volumes of data streaming from devices. Azure Time Series Insights Azure Time Series Insights stores the telemetry from the devices connected to the solution accelerator. It also enables visualizing and querying device telemetry in the solution web UI. Configuration microservice The configuration microservice provides a RESTful endpoint for CRUD operations on device groups, solution settings, and user-settings in the solution accelerator. It works with the storage adapter microservice to persist the configuration data. Authentication and authorization microservice The authentication and authorization microservice manages the users authorized to access the solution accelerator. User management supports a variety of identity service provides that support OpenId Connect, including Azure B2C."

The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’, a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh, which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research version of Unix. Bash is largely compatible with sh and incorporates useful features from the Korn shell ksh and the C shell csh. It is intended to be a conformant implementation of the IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1). It offers functional improvements over sh for both interactive and programming use. While the GNU operating system provides other shells, including a version of csh, Bash is the default shell. Like other GNU software, Bash is quite portable. It currently runs on nearly every version of Unix and a few other operating systems - independently-supported ports exist for MS-DOS, OS/2, and Windows platforms. The improvements offered by Bash include: Command line editing Unlimited size command history Job Control Shell Functions and Aliases Indexed arrays of unlimited size Integer arithmetic in any base from two to sixty-four Download There are many ways to install bash. A couple options are as following: GNU Bash can be found on the main GNU ftp server: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/ (via HTTP) and ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/ (via FTP).

Alternative Setup It might now be possible to use use Docker on Windows without having to virtualize thanks to the release of the Linux subsystem for Windows. This approach has not been tested to determine if it will work for this solution. It allows you to run Unbuntu and openSUSE on Windows, with Fedora and more Linux distributions coming soon. As untried alternative to virtualization, if you're using Windows you could try the Linux subsystem for Windows. Note: We have not tried this. Key consideration is whether or not docker images can be instantiated.

Additional details about configuring and switching versions using NVM are below Another helpful guide is: Set up your Node.js development environment directly on Windows NVM Alternatives If you have install issues with NVM or are running on a non-windows machine, try the following: While windows-nvm is currently the most popular version manager for node, there are alternatives to consider: nvs (Node Version Switcher) is a cross-platform nvm alternative with the ability to integrate with VS Code . Volta is a new version manager from the LinkedIn team that claims improved speed and cross-platform support. To install Volta as your version manager (rather than windows-nvm), go to the Windows Installation section of their Getting Started guide , then download and run their Windows installer, following the setup instructions. Important: You must ensure that Developer Mode is enabled on your Windows machine before installing Volta. To learn more about using Volta to install multiple versions of Node.js on Windows, see the Volta Docs . Node Version Manager (NVM) Use Node Version Manager (NVM) to support multiple versions: Windows: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows Linux and MAC: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm Note This solution uses older versions of NodeJS. Uses older versions will cause warning to be triggered like: npm WARN npm npm does not support Node.js vXX.XX.XX These can be ignored. It's best to do uninstall any direct node installs before installing NVM. Even though the install on windows seems to merge existing installs, you'll likely still run into issues with the Node Package Manager (NPM). See Uninstall Existing Node Documentation below: Once installed, run the following to install the latest version of NodeJS: Useful NVS Commands List Versions currently installed \"engines\" : { \"node\" : \">=0.12\" } list Install version nvm install \"latest\" or nvm install 10.1 Set current version nvm use 10.1 Set NPM Versions You can change your NPM Versions up or down using the following Getting Lastest NPM Node comes with npm installed so you should have a version of npm. However, npm gets updated more frequently than Node does, so you'll want to make sure it's the latest version. npm install npm@latest -g Targeting Specific NPM Version Just replace @latest with the version number you want to downgrade to. I wanted to downgrade to version 3.10.10, so I used this command: npm install -g npm@3.10.10 Note: If you do a lot of version switching, you might run into the following issue: Error: Node Sass does not yet support your current orted please see: environment: Windows 64-bit with Unsupported runtim1.0e There's an easy fix: npm rebuild node-sass Additional information can be found here . This approach requires python to be installed. Uninstall Existing Node and NPM Versions Uninstall existing Node Version Please note, you need to uninstall any existing versions of node.js before installing NVM for Windows. Also delete any existing nodejs installation directories (e.g., \"C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\") that might remain. NVM's generated symlink will not overwrite an existing (even empty) installation directory. Uninstall existing NPM Version You should also delete the existing npm install location (e.g. \"C:\\Users<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\"), so that the nvm install location will be correctly used instead. Backup the global npmrc config (e.g. C:\\Users\\&lt;user&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\etc\\npmrc ), if you have some important settings there, or copy the settings to the user config C:\\Users\\&lt;user&gt;\\.npmrc . Helpful Tools TOOL DESCRIPTION NOTES NPM-Check Display package versions and if updates are available. Warning: Careful on making updates. Those are sweeping changes that shouldn't be taken lightly (unless of course you're not installing into the solution or changing dependencies) . ESLint Issues Sometimes ESLint causes a lot of issues. This often happens on a fresh clone that came from a repo built by a different OS. This issue can be easily resolved by running: npm run lint -- --fix"
