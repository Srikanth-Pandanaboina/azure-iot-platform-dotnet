    "keywords": "This documentation helps in understanding the use of each and every UI test. Here are some of the guidelines that are to be followed while creating new test: Here are some things to put down for guidelines for writing UI (and API) tests: Each UI test method should have no dependencies on any other UI tests. Each test stands alone and does its own init and cleanup. When creating UI test classes, derive from UiTestBase Specifies the Trait and Collection attributes. Do not specify these attributes on the class itself. Provides common properties and methods useful for writing UI test code (e.g., WebDriver property) Use the plural form for the test class name E.g., UiTests instead of UiTest Use Pascal-case for all class names, file names, and public element names E.g., UiTests instead of UITests Ensure the namespace name reflects the folder path E.g., UI tests should be in the Mmm.Iot.FunctionalTests.UiTests namespace Perform post-processing on C# code produced by Selenium IDE Use this.WebDriver.Value Replace all waits with this.DefaultWait, unless a different wait time/behavior is needed, in which case define the new wait as a variable in the test method or class so that it can be reused in place of instantiating new wait objects all over the place Omit unnecessary statements/actions (e.g., clicks). Aim to use the fewest possible number of statements/actions to successfully automate the browser for the task at hand. Modify any selectors to omit any/all text visible to end-users. No button names, link names, etc. should be used in selectors because those things are likely to change and break tests if used in selectors. Evaluate selectors to see if the HTML id attribute can be used. If the element being selected does not have an ID attribute, can one be added? If id is unavailable, consider whether name or class attributes are unique and robust enough. Shorten all XPath selectors and/or CSS selectors to omit unnecessary components. Shorter selectors are more robust and more likely to survive changes to the page structure. Call this.WebDriver.Value.Close(); at the end of the test Save one or more screenshots by calling this.SaveScreenshot For the screenshot name, use the name of the test as obtained by the use of the nameof operator When saving multiple screenshots, use the name of the test from nameof concatenated with a hyphen and a short distinguishing phrase or identifier E.g., this.SaveScreenshot($\"{nameof(TenantSwitchingTest)}-BeforeSwitch\"); To generate random strings or numbers, use the TestStack.Dossier library and its AnonymousValueFixture class"

The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’, a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh, which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research version of Unix. Bash is largely compatible with sh and incorporates useful features from the Korn shell ksh and the C shell csh. It is intended to be a conformant implementation of the IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1). It offers functional improvements over sh for both interactive and programming use. While the GNU operating system provides other shells, including a version of csh, Bash is the default shell. Like other GNU software, Bash is quite portable. It currently runs on nearly every version of Unix and a few other operating systems - independently-supported ports exist for MS-DOS, OS/2, and Windows platforms. The improvements offered by Bash include: Command line editing Unlimited size command history Job Control Shell Functions and Aliases Indexed arrays of unlimited size Integer arithmetic in any base from two to sixty-four Download There are many ways to install bash.

For more information, see Virtualization. For additional information about requirements see: What to know before you install . Steps to setup Docker on Windows Download Docker Desktop https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/ Double-click Docker Desktop Installer.exe to run the installer. If you haven’t already downloaded the installer (Docker Desktop Installer.exe), you can get it from Docker Hub . It typically downloads to your Downloads folder, or you can run it from the recent downloads bar at the bottom of your web browser. Follow instructions on the installation wizard to accept the license, authorize the installer, and proceed with the install. When prompted, authorize the Docker Desktop Installer with your system password during the install process. Privileged access is needed to install networking components, links to the Docker apps, and manage the Hyper-V VMs. Click Finish on the setup complete dialog and launch the Docker Desktop application. For additional information, see Install Docker Desktop on Windows . To test your installation, follow this guide . Alternative Setup It might now be possible to use use Docker on Windows without having to virtualize thanks to the release of the Linux subsystem for Windows. This approach has not been tested to determine if it will work for this solution. It allows you to run Unbuntu and openSUSE on Windows, with Fedora and more Linux distributions coming soon. As untried alternative to virtualization, if you're using Windows you could try the Linux subsystem for Windows. Note: We have not tried this.

The speed comes from Google's non-blocking IO model. BE SURE TO TARGET VERSIONS: NPM 6.4.1 NODE 10.14.1 (local) 11.1 (prod) We recommended using Node Version Manager (NVM) for Windows to be able to support switching between NodeJS versions (which also influences the active NPM version). We have found install issues on some Windows 10 Machines running McAfee. Follow these instructions to avoid install issues: https://medium.com/@tysonpaul89/maintain-multiple-versions-of-node-js-in-windows-operating-system-using-nvm-3c6bf5b63f29 Alternatively, to install NodeJS directly go to https://nodejs.org/ , but you want be able to switch versions so be sure to install the correct version (see above). Additional details about configuring and switching versions using NVM are below Another helpful guide is: Set up your Node.js development environment directly on Windows NVM Alternatives If you have install issues with NVM or are running on a non-windows machine, try the following: While windows-nvm is currently the most popular version manager for node, there are alternatives to consider: nvs (Node Version Switcher) is a cross-platform nvm alternative with the ability to integrate with VS Code . Volta is a new version manager from the LinkedIn team that claims improved speed and cross-platform support. To install Volta as your version manager (rather than windows-nvm), go to the Windows Installation section of their Getting Started guide , then download and run their Windows installer, following the setup instructions. Important: You must ensure that Developer Mode is enabled on your Windows machine before installing Volta. To learn more about using Volta to install multiple versions of Node.js on Windows, see the Volta Docs . Node Version Manager (NVM) Use Node Version Manager (NVM) to support multiple versions: Windows: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows Linux and MAC: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm Note This solution uses older versions of NodeJS. Uses older versions will cause warning to be triggered like: npm WARN npm npm does not support Node.js vXX.XX.XX These can be ignored. It's best to do uninstall any direct node installs before installing NVM. Even though the install on windows seems to merge existing installs, you'll likely still run into issues with the Node Package Manager (NPM). See Uninstall Existing Node Documentation below: Once installed, run the following to install the latest version of NodeJS: Useful NVS Commands List Versions currently installed \"engines\" : { \"node\" : \">=0.12\" } list Install version nvm install \"latest\" or nvm install 10.1 Set current version nvm use 10.1 Set NPM Versions You can change your NPM Versions up or down using the following Getting Lastest NPM Node comes with npm installed so you should have a version of npm. However, npm gets updated more frequently than Node does, so you'll want to make sure it's the latest version. npm install npm@latest -g Targeting Specific NPM Version Just replace @latest with the version number you want to downgrade to. I wanted to downgrade to version 3.10.10, so I used this command: npm install -g npm@3.10.10 Note: If you do a lot of version switching, you might run into the following issue: Error: Node Sass does not yet support your current orted please see: environment: Windows 64-bit with Unsupported runtim1.0e There's an easy fix: npm rebuild node-sass Additional information can be found here . This approach requires python to be installed. Uninstall Existing Node and NPM Versions Uninstall existing Node Version Please note, you need to uninstall any existing versions of node.js before installing NVM for Windows. Also delete any existing nodejs installation directories (e.g., \"C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\") that might remain. NVM's generated symlink will not overwrite an existing (even empty) installation directory. Uninstall existing NPM Version You should also delete the existing npm install location (e.g. \"C:\\Users<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\"), so that the nvm install location will be correctly used instead. Backup the global npmrc config (e.g. C:\\Users\\&lt;user&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\etc\\npmrc ), if you have some important settings there, or copy the settings to the user config C:\\Users\\&lt;user&gt;\\.npmrc . Helpful Tools TOOL DESCRIPTION NOTES NPM-Check Display package versions and if updates are available. Warning: Careful on making updates. Those are sweeping changes that shouldn't be taken lightly (unless of course you're not installing into the solution or changing dependencies) . ESLint Issues Sometimes ESLint causes a lot of issues. This often happens on a fresh clone that came from a repo built by a different OS. This issue can be easily resolved by running: npm run lint -- --fix"
