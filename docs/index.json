    "keywords": "Architecture The 3M IoT Platform on Azure consists of the following subsystems: 1) devices (and/or on premise edge gateways) that have the ability to securely register with the cloud, and connectivity options for sending and receiving data with the cloud, 2) a cloud gateway service, or hub, to securely accept that data and provide device management capabilities, 3) stream processors that consume that data, integrate with business processes, and place the data into storage, and 4) a user interface to visualize telemetry data and facilitate device management. Security is a critical consideration in each of the subsystems. The platform protects IoT devices, data, and communication by securely provisioning devices, secure connectivity between devices, edge devices, and the cloud, secure access to the backend solutions, and secure data protection in the cloud during processing and storage (encryption at rest). The platform's use of Azure IoT Hub offers a fully-managed service that enables reliable and secure bi-directional communication between IoT devices and Azure services such as Azure Machine Learning and Azure Stream Analytics by using per-device security credentials and access control. Both Azure Cosmos DB for warm path storage and Azure Blob Storage for cold storage are available and support encryption at rest. All data access and permissions are governed by Azure Active Directory. External access is available via OpenID Connectivity as needed. <!-- Consider adding information about: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/application-gateway-ingress-controller-for-azure-kubernetes-service/ -->"

    "keywords": "3M IoT Platform Overview The 3M IoT Platform on Azure, called Serenity, provides essential services for managing devices at scale. It can be used directly via it's web UI or programmatically via APIs. Product teams across 3M are using Serenity to accelerate innovation. The platform standardizes aspects of each innovation by providing core capabilities needed in any IoT scenarios, including device management services, security monitoring, and CI/CD. The platform allows adopters to focus on unique IoT objectives rather than having to build, validate, and independently maintain common services. The code for the 3M IoT Platform is open source, available on GitHub . Use it to request features, track improvements, and even make contribution to platform enhancements. Logical Components The following diagram outlines the logical components of the platform and highlights the primary Azure Resources that it uses. IoT Hub The IoT Hub is a Microsoft Azure Resource used to ingest telemetry sent from both real and simulated devices into the cloud. The hub makes the telemetry available to the services in the IoT solution for processing. The IoT Hub also provides the following: Maintains an identity registry that stores the IDs and authentication keys of all the devices permitted to connect to the portal. Invokes methods on your devices on behalf of the solution accelerator. Maintains device twins for all registered devices. A device twin stores the property values reported by a device. A device twin also stores desired properties, set in the solution portal, for the device to retrieve when it next connects. Schedules jobs to set properties for multiple devices or invoke methods on multiple devices. Web UI A web user interface is available for device management. This presentation offers a user friendly way to register and configure devices, deploy firmware, and manage alerts, and provides a dashboard for generally observing device telemetry. The web user interface is a React Javascript application that: Is served to the browser via backend services Is styled with Css and SaSS Interacts with other backend services like the authentication and authorization service to protect user data and communicate with Azure resources Backend Services The platform is made up of several services running in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) . The platform containerizes services to offer enterprise-grade security and scalability. The services - often called microservices - are written in .NET (C#) and provide RESTful endpoints that can be used for direct integration in business specific solutions. Data processing and analytics The solution includes the following components in the data processing and analytics part of the logical architecture: IoT Hub manager The solution includes the IoT Hub manager microservice to handle interactions with your IoT hub such as: Creating and managing IoT devices. Managing device twins. Invoking methods on devices. Managing IoT credentials. This service also runs IoT Hub queries to retrieve devices belonging to user-defined groups. The microservice provides a RESTful endpoint to manage devices and device twins, invoke methods, and run IoT Hub queries. Device telemetry The device telemetry microservice provides a RESTful endpoint for read access to device telemetry stored in Time Series Insights. The RESTful endpoint also enables CRUD operations on rules and read/write access for alarm definitions from storage. Storage adapter The storage adapter microservice manages key-value pairs, abstracting the storage service semantics, and presenting a simple interface to store data of any format using Azure Cosmos DB. Values are organized in collections. You can work on individual values or fetch entire collections. Complex data structures are serialized by the clients and managed as simple text payload. The service provides a RESTful endpoint for CRUD operations on key-value pairs. Azure Cosmos DB Deployments use Azure Cosmos DB to store rules, alerts, configuration settings, and all other cold storage. Azure Stream Analytics The Azure Stream Analytics manager microservice manages Azure Stream Analytics (ASA) jobs, including setting their configuration, starting and stopping them, and monitoring their status. The ASA job is supported by two reference data sets. One data set defines rules and one defines device groups. The rules reference data is generated from the information managed by the device telemetry microservice. The Azure Stream Analytics manager microservice transforms telemetry rules into stream processing logic. The device groups reference data is used to identify which group of rules to apply to an incoming telemetry message. The device groups are managed by the configuration microservice and use Azure IoT Hub device twin queries. The ASA jobs deliver the telemetry from the connected devices to Time Series Insights for storage and analysis. Azure Stream Analytics is an event-processing engine that allows you to examine high volumes of data streaming from devices. Azure Time Series Insights Azure Time Series Insights stores the telemetry from the devices connected to the solution accelerator. It also enables visualizing and querying device telemetry in the solution web UI. Authentication and authorization microservice The authentication and authorization microservice manages the users authorized to access the solution accelerator. User management supports a variety of identity service provides that support OpenId Connect, including Azure B2C. <!-- Azure IoT Hub Azure IoT Edge Azure Storage Azure Data Lake Azure Cosmos DB Azure SQL Database Azure HDInsight Azure Stream Analytics Azure Service Bus Azure Event Hubs Azure Web Apps Azure Mobile Apps Azure Logic Apps Azure Notification Hubs Azure Machine Learning Azure Machine Learning Studio Power BI Azure Active Directory Azure Key Vault AMQP AMQP Core MQTT Azure VPN VPN Gateways and Secure CrossPremises Connectivity Azure API applications Azure Search Azure Maps Service Fabric Azure Batch -->"

The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’, a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh, which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research version of Unix. Bash is largely compatible with sh and incorporates useful features from the Korn shell ksh and the C shell csh. It is intended to be a conformant implementation of the IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1). It offers functional improvements over sh for both interactive and programming use. While the GNU operating system provides other shells, including a version of csh, Bash is the default shell. Like other GNU software, Bash is quite portable. It currently runs on nearly every version of Unix and a few other operating systems - independently-supported ports exist for MS-DOS, OS/2, and Windows platforms. The improvements offered by Bash include: Command line editing Unlimited size command history Job Control Shell Functions and Aliases Indexed arrays of unlimited size Integer arithmetic in any base from two to sixty-four Download There are many ways to install bash. A couple options are as following: GNU Bash can be found on the main GNU ftp server: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/ (via HTTP) and ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/ (via FTP).

Docker on Windows What to know before installation Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Build 15063 or later). Hyper-V and Containers Windows features must be enabled. The following hardware prerequisites are required to successfully run Client Hyper-V on Windows 10: 64-bit processor with Second Level Address Translation (SLAT) 4GB system RAM BIOS-level hardware virtualization support must be enabled in the BIOS settings. For more information, see Virtualization. For additional information about requirements see: What to know before you install . Steps to setup Docker on Windows Download Docker Desktop https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/ Double-click Docker Desktop Installer.exe to run the installer. If you haven’t already downloaded the installer (Docker Desktop Installer.exe), you can get it from Docker Hub . It typically downloads to your Downloads folder, or you can run it from the recent downloads bar at the bottom of your web browser. Follow instructions on the installation wizard to accept the license, authorize the installer, and proceed with the install. When prompted, authorize the Docker Desktop Installer with your system password during the install process. Privileged access is needed to install networking components, links to the Docker apps, and manage the Hyper-V VMs. Click Finish on the setup complete dialog and launch the Docker Desktop application. For additional information, see Install Docker Desktop on Windows . To test your installation, follow this guide . Alternative Setup It might now be possible to use use Docker on Windows without having to virtualize thanks to the release of the Linux subsystem for Windows. This approach has not been tested to determine if it will work for this solution. It allows you to run Unbuntu and openSUSE on Windows, with Fedora and more Linux distributions coming soon. As untried alternative to virtualization, if you're using Windows you could try the Linux subsystem for Windows. Note: We have not tried this. Key consideration is whether or not docker images can be instantiated. This documented might be a good guide: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/set-up-environment?tabs=Windows-10-Client For additional information on the Linux Subsystem: The Windows Subsystem for Linux, introduced in the Anniversary Update , became a stable feature in the Fall Creators Update ."

You can download it here: https://www.7-zip.org/download.html Steps to Install Download the latest version of the compressed executable from the Helm GitHub site, https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/releases . Navigate to the folder you downloaded the helm-vX.X.X-windows-amd64.tar.gz compressed file from and move the file to its own directory. Navigate to the new directory and right click on the tar.gz file and with 7Zip, open the tar.gz archive. Double click the single tar file in that directory, helm-v2.7.2-windows-amd64.tar. You should now see a windows file folder in the 7Zip window, windows-amd64. Right click on the folder, select Copy To, and select the directory you want to copy the folder to. add the helm program to the System File path to make it easily accessible from the command line. Open the Control Panel’s System panel. Select the Advanced system settings link on the left. Select Environment Variables. Under System variables, select Path, and then select Edit. Select the New button and then add the folder path where you copied the helm folder to and then press OK. Open a new command line window and type helm on the command line to make sure you have access to helm from the command line. Assuming you have the kubectl program configured for your Kubernetes cluster you can now initialize helm. Now you are ready to deploy Kubernetes applications to your kube cluster. Note: Ubuntu and an evaluation copy of Windows. Otherwise you need an ISO and License Key for the OS you intend to install. Using the eval requires a 16GB download."

The speed comes from Google's non-blocking IO model. ❗️❗️❗️ BE SURE TO TARGET VERSIONS: NPM 6.4.1 NODE 10.14.1 (local) 11.1 (prod) For the official installation documentation, check out: NPM & Node We recommended using Node Version Manager (NVM) for Windows to be able to support switching between NodeJS versions (which also influences the active NPM version). We have found install issues on some Windows 10 Machines running McAfee. Follow these instructions to avoid install issues: https://medium.com/@tysonpaul89/maintain-multiple-versions-of-node-js-in-windows-operating-system-using-nvm-3c6bf5b63f29 Alternatively, to install NodeJS directly go to https://nodejs.org/ , but you want be able to switch versions so be sure to install the correct version (see above). Additional details about configuring and switching versions using NVM are below Another helpful guide is: Set up your Node.js development environment directly on Windows NVM Alternatives If you have install issues with NVM or are running on a non-windows machine, try the following: While windows-nvm is currently the most popular version manager for node, there are alternatives to consider: nvs (Node Version Switcher) is a cross-platform nvm alternative with the ability to integrate with VS Code . Volta is a new version manager from the LinkedIn team that claims improved speed and cross-platform support. To install Volta as your version manager (rather than windows-nvm), go to the Windows Installation section of their Getting Started guide , then download and run their Windows installer, following the setup instructions. Important: You must ensure that Developer Mode is enabled on your Windows machine before installing Volta. To learn more about using Volta to install multiple versions of Node.js on Windows, see the Volta Docs . Node Version Manager (NVM) Use Node Version Manager (NVM) to support multiple versions: Windows: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows Linux and MAC: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm Note This solution uses older versions of NodeJS. Uses older versions will cause warning to be triggered like: npm WARN npm npm does not support Node.js vXX.XX.XX These can be ignored. It's best to do uninstall any direct node installs before installing NVM. Even though the install on windows seems to merge existing installs, you'll likely still run into issues with the Node Package Manager (NPM). See Uninstall Existing Node Documentation below: Once installed, run the following to install the latest version of NodeJS: Useful NVS Commands List Versions currently installed \"engines\" : { \"node\" : \">=0.12\" } list Install version nvm install \"latest\" or nvm install 10.1 Set current version nvm use 10.1 Set NPM Versions You can change your NPM Versions up or down using the following Getting Lastest NPM Node comes with npm installed so you should have a version of npm. However, npm gets updated more frequently than Node does, so you'll want to make sure it's the latest version. npm install npm@latest -g Targeting Specific NPM Version Just replace @latest with the version number you want to downgrade to. I wanted to downgrade to version 3.10.10, so I used this command: npm install -g npm@3.10.10 Note: If you do a lot of version switching, you might run into the following issue: Error: Node Sass does not yet support your current orted please see: environment: Windows 64-bit with Unsupported runtim1.0e There's an easy fix: npm rebuild node-sass Additional information can be found here . This approach requires python to be installed. Uninstall Existing Node and NPM Versions Uninstall existing Node Version Please note, you need to uninstall any existing versions of node.js before installing NVM for Windows. Also delete any existing nodejs installation directories (e.g., \"C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\") that might remain. NVM's generated symlink will not overwrite an existing (even empty) installation directory. Uninstall existing NPM Version You should also delete the existing npm install location (e.g. \"C:\\Users<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\"), so that the nvm install location will be correctly used instead. Backup the global npmrc config (e.g. C:\\Users\\&lt;user&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\etc\\npmrc ), if you have some important settings there, or copy the settings to the user config C:\\Users\\&lt;user&gt;\\.npmrc . Helpful Tools TOOL DESCRIPTION NOTES NPM-Check Display package versions and if updates are available. Warning: Careful on making updates. Those are sweeping changes that shouldn't be taken lightly (unless of course you're not installing into the solution or changing dependencies) . ESLint Issues Sometimes ESLint causes a lot of issues. This often happens on a fresh clone that came from a repo built by a different OS. This issue can be easily resolved by running: npm run lint -- --fix"

Therefore, you must provide the value in the --build-args option of the docker build command. docker build --file ./<service-name>/WebService/Dockerfile --build-arg AppConfigurationConnectionString=$AppConfgurationConnectionString . where $AppConfigurationConnectionString is either an environment variable or dotnet user secret. E.g., to build the Storage Adapter container image: docker build --file ./storage-adapter/WebService/Dockerfile --build-arg AppConfigurationConnectionString=$AppConfgurationConnectionString . Running Run all services Azure DevSpaces Non-Windows First, setup your Azure DevSpaces for use azds use \\ --name <Name of your managed kubernetes cluster> \\ --resource-group <Name of the resource group your cluster is within> After setting up Azure DevSpaces, you can build and run each microservice in Azure DevSpaces. From the root of the project, run the script up.sh . To build and run each service in Azure DevSpaces. ./up.sh Each service that is built and ran by up.sh has a unqiue url in the format of http://my-dev-space.s.default.service-name.ABC1234DE.cus.azds.io . You can use this url to begin making requests to each service's API endpoints. Run an individual service The simplest is to use dotnet run to spin up a service on a random port on localhost: dotnet run --project ./<service-name>/WebService/WebService.csproj Debugging Use either Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code"

    "keywords": "User Profile Below are the details and available actions in the User Profile flyout: Tenants View Tenants Switch Tenant Edit Tenant Name Delete Tenant Create New Tenant Roles Permissions Development Variables Logout Steps to access the User Profile : Login to the application. Click on the Person icon in the upper right. The User Profile flyout opens Tenants This sections shows the list of tenants to which you are assigned along with other options to manage tenants. View Tenants In the Tenants section, a table shows the list of assigned tenants. The following columns appear in the Tenants grid: Column Name Description Tenant Name of the tenant Role The role assigned to the user for this tenant Action Shows the actions available, like Edit and Delete Switch Tenant You can switch tenants if more than one tenant is assigned. To switch the tenant: If there are tenants in the list other than the current one, there will be a link on the tenant name that can be used to switch the current tenant. Click the tenant name link to switch. Ex: From the screenshot below, the current tenant is tenant#233a1 . Clicking on tenant#209d7 would switch to this tenant. The application refreshes with the current tenant updated. Edit Tenant Name You can edit the tenant name by following the below steps: In the tenant row, click Edit . The tenant name becomes editable; update the name and click Save . Delete Tenant You can delete a tenant by following the below steps: In the tenant row click Delete . The tenant is deleted. Note ❌: Once a tenant is deleted, the action cannot be reversed. You need to be extra cautious when deleting a tenant. Create a New Tenant You can create a new tenant by following the below steps: Under the tenants section, click the button Create New Tenant . A new tenant with a unique tenant name is created and is added as a new row in the tenant list. This tenant will be available to access only after it is fully deployed. This might take a few minutes. Meanwhile, a message will pop up while trying to access it. You should be able to Switch to the newly created tenant after a few minutes, once it is fully deployed. Note ❌: Avoid creating unnecessary tenants as they may result in increased cost. Roles This sections shows the logged in user's role for current tenant. These roles are assigned while creating a new user . By default, there are just two possible roles for a remote monitoring solution: Admin Read Only Note: Custom roles can also be added, refer to this for more information Permissions This section shows the permissions of a user based on the user's role. Any user in the Admin role has full access to the solution, including the below permissions. A user in the Read Only role will only have access to view the solution. Note: For more information on this, refer to role-based access control . Development Variables This section has user development variables like: User Token Payload information with Username, TenantId, UserRole, available tenants, IsSystemAdmin etc. Logout To logout from the application, click the Logout button."

Simulated devices are used to test connectivity and offer a quick way to evaluate functionality without needing to procure any hardware. There are two types of real devices: IoT Edge device and IoT device. If you'd like to learn more about the types of devices that can work with Azure check out Microsoft's Device Catalog Device Registration Before you can use a real or simulated device, you must first register it.

You have the opportunity to save the device connection string that contains these credentials when you add the device to the solution. You include the device connection string in your client application later in this tutorial. To add a device to your Remote Monitoring solution, complete the following steps on the Device Explorer page in the solution: Choose + New device , and then choose Real as the Device type : Enter a Device ID you wish to use to reference this device or allow the system to generate one for you. The value must be unique and connect include spaces. Select the desired authentication type and either have the system generate authentication keys for you or provide your own. CRSL generally uses a Symmetric Key but your organization might prefer x509. Chose whichever is the most approriate. Select the preferred option for how to define keys. You have the choice between: Providing your own Auto Generating"

Note: The example used is to explain how to simulate Device data using connection string of a device. The step#1(Creating a device) can be skipped if the device is already present and connection string is available. Step-1: Creating a Device Create a device and fetch the connection string. Ex: (Using web application) Login to CRSL or PSD portal Go to Device Explorer and click New Device Give the inputs for creating a new device a. Device type: IoT Device/IoT Edge Device b. Device ID: Custom DeviceID or System generated DeviceID c. Authentication type: Symmetric key/ X.509 d. Authentication keys: Autogenerated/Enter manually (Primary and Secondary) e. Click on create/apply Once the device is connected, copy the connection strings (Sample connection string: HostName=iothub-233a1ca2.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=9db19edd-ba26-4e56-80f8-63582f0d1f8c;SharedAccessKey=bjRJEOgHkRxfefNnO4AfakB7No7bzIC3yqeHVlu/F2E=) Note: For creating a device in IoT hub, refer this: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-web-simulator-get-started#register-a-new-device-in-the-iot-hub Step-2: Simulate Device telemetry Launch the Raspberry Pi online Simulator using: https://azure-samples.github.io/raspberry-pi-web-simulator/#getstarted The simulator has three areas a. Assembly area: Preview of the default circuit b. Coding area: An online code editor where the application to collect and send data in the simulator resides. Note: A default sample application is present in this area which helps to collect sensor data from BME280 sensor and sends to your Azure IoT Hub. This is fully compatible with real Pi devices c. Integrated Console window: Shows the output of your code. And it has three buttons i. Run: Run the application from the coding area ii. Reset: Resets the coding area to the default application by undoing the changes you made iii. Fold/Expand: Used to fold/expand the console window 3. In the coding area, if you are running the default application, scroll to the connectionString constant assignment(line.15) and replace the default placeholder with your device connection string from Step-1. Run code: Select Run from console window or type npm start to run the application Output: You should see the following output that shows the sensor data and the messages that are sent to your IoT hub Step-3: Verify telemetry data Telemetry data is sent and can be verified either through Azure portal or web application References: • https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-web-simulator-get-started • https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-vscode-iot-toolkit-cloud-device-messaging"
